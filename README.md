## Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra

#### This project, part of the [Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027), consists of the creation of an ETL Data Pipeline using music streaming data files and Apache Cassandra. The purpose of this project is to model a Cassandra database structure  that will allow for queries outlined in the notebook.

### Project Requirements

	jupyterlab==3.0.16
	pandas==1.3.0
	cassandra-driver==3.25.0

You must also have a testing environment that consists of an [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) database. This project was tested using a local copy of Cassandra running via [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
